: is a sudo selector from which using nth-of-type 

The :nth-of-type(n) selector matches every element that is the nth child, of the same type (tag name), of its parent.

n can be a number, a keyword (odd or even), or a formula (like an + b).

In this case I used a number to target the 4th and 5th element.
